## ADR-001: Component-Based Architecture

### Context
We needed to build a complex dashboard with multiple data visualizations, tables, and interactive elements. The application needs to be maintainable and scalable.

### Decision
Implement a component-based architecture using React with TypeScript.

### Rationale
- **Reusability**: Components can be reused across different parts of the dashboard
- **Maintainability**: Each component has a single responsibility
- **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript provides compile-time error checking
- **Developer Experience**: Strong ecosystem and tooling support

### Consequences
**Positive**:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to add new features
- Better code organization
- Improved collaboration between developers

**Negative**:
- Initial setup time for component structure
- Learning curve for TypeScript
- More boilerplate code compared to vanilla JavaScript

### Alternatives Considered
- Vue.js with Composition API
- Angular with TypeScript
- Vanilla JavaScript with Web Components

## ADR-002: Mock Data Strategy

### Context
The dashboard needs to display data, but backend APIs are not yet available. We need a way to develop and test the frontend independently.

### Decision
Create a centralized mock data file (`src/data/dashboardData.ts`) that exports all dashboard data with proper TypeScript interfaces.

### Rationale
- **Development Speed**: Frontend development can proceed without waiting for backend
- **Predictable Data**: Consistent data structure for development and testing
- **Easy Migration**: Single file to replace when connecting to real APIs
- **Type Safety**: Interfaces ensure data structure consistency
- **Testing**: Simplified unit and integration testing

### Implementation
```typescript
// src/data/dashboardData.ts
interface DashboardData {
  metrics: MetricsData;
  ticketsByAgent: AgentData[];
  // ... other interfaces
}

export const dashboardData: DashboardData = { /* ... */ };
```

### Migration Path
When backend APIs are ready:
1. Create API service layer (`src/services/api.ts`)
2. Replace mock data imports with API calls
3. Add loading states and error handling
4. Implement data caching if needed

### Consequences
**Positive**:
- Parallel frontend/backend development
- Easy to modify data for different scenarios
- No need for mock API server
- Quick iteration on UI/UX

**Negative**:
- Mock data needs to be maintained
- Doesn't test real API integration
- May miss edge cases in real data

## ADR-003: Tailwind CSS for Styling

### Context
The dashboard requires consistent styling, responsive design, and rapid UI development.

### Decision
Use Tailwind CSS utility-first framework for all styling needs.

### Rationale
- **Development Speed**: No need to write custom CSS for common patterns
- **Consistency**: Pre-defined spacing, colors, and sizing
- **Responsive**: Built-in responsive utilities
- **Small Bundle**: PurgeCSS removes unused styles in production
- **No Naming Conflicts**: Utility classes eliminate CSS naming issues

### Usage Pattern
```tsx
<div className="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-200">
  <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-4">Title</h3>
  <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">Content</p>
</div>
```

### Consequences
**Positive**:
- Faster development
- Smaller CSS bundle in production
- Excellent documentation
- Easy to maintain consistent design

**Negative**:
- Verbose className strings
- Learning curve for team members
- Potential coupling between HTML and styles

### Alternatives Considered
- CSS Modules
- Styled Components
- Emotion
- SASS/SCSS

## ADR-004: Recharts for Data Visualization

### Context
The dashboard requires multiple chart types (line, bar, pie, donut) with interactive features.

### Decision
Use Recharts as the primary charting library.

### Rationale
- **React-First**: Built specifically for React
- **Declarative**: Composable chart components
- **Customizable**: Extensive configuration options
- **Responsive**: Built-in responsive behavior
- **TypeScript Support**: Full type definitions
- **Active Maintenance**: Regular updates and bug fixes

### Chart Types Used
- Line Charts: Trends over time
- Bar Charts: Comparative data
- Pie/Donut Charts: Category distribution
- Composed Charts: Multiple data series

### Example
```tsx
<ResponsiveContainer width="100%" height={300}>
  <LineChart data={chartData}>
    <XAxis dataKey="month" />
    <YAxis />
    <Tooltip />
    <Line type="monotone" dataKey="value" stroke="#3b82f6" />
  </LineChart>
</ResponsiveContainer>
```

### Consequences
**Positive**:
- Consistent chart styling
- Easy to implement complex visualizations
- Good performance with large datasets
- Accessible by default

**Negative**:
- Bundle size increase (~100KB)
- Limited 3D chart support
- Some advanced features require workarounds

### Alternatives Considered
- Chart.js with react-chartjs-2
- Victory Charts
- Nivo Charts
- D3.js (too low-level for our needs)

## ADR-005: No Global State Management

### Context
Dashboard has multiple components that need to share data and state.

### Decision
Use React hooks (useState, useEffect) for local state management. No Redux, MobX, or Context API for global state.

### Rationale
- **Simplicity**: Current app complexity doesn't justify global state
- **Performance**: No unnecessary re-renders from global state changes
- **Learning Curve**: Easier for new developers
- **Bundle Size**: No additional libraries needed
- **Future-Proof**: Can add global state management later if needed

### Current State Structure
- Component-level state for UI interactions
- Props drilling for parent-child communication
- Mock data imported directly into components

### When to Reconsider
Add global state management when:
- State is shared across 3+ component levels
- Multiple components need to update the same data
- Real-time updates from WebSocket/SSE
- Complex authentication state

### Consequences
**Positive**:
- Simpler codebase
- Easier debugging
- Less boilerplate
- Faster initial development

**Negative**:
- Props drilling in some cases
- Potential refactoring needed if app grows
- State duplication in some scenarios

## ADR-006: TypeScript Interfaces Over Types

### Context
Need to define data structures for dashboard components.

### Decision
Use TypeScript `interface` declarations for all data structures instead of `type` aliases.

### Rationale
- **Extensibility**: Interfaces can be extended and merged
- **Better Error Messages**: More readable compiler errors
- **Declaration Merging**: Can augment interfaces later
- **Convention**: Industry standard for object shapes
- **Performance**: Slightly better compiler performance

### Example
```typescript
interface ApprovalItem {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  module: string;
  status: 'Pending' | 'In Progress' | 'Closed';
}

interface IncidentTicket extends ApprovalItem {
  priority: string;
  assignedTo: string;
}
```

### When to Use Types
- Union types: `type Status = 'open' | 'closed'`
- Mapped types: `type Readonly<T> = { readonly [P in keyof T]: T[P] }`
- Complex type operations

### Consequences
**Positive**:
- Consistent codebase
- Easier to extend data structures
- Better IDE support

**Negative**:
- Some features only available with types
- Team needs to understand the difference

## ADR-007: Mobile-First Responsive Design

### Context
Dashboard needs to work on various screen sizes from mobile to desktop.

### Decision
Implement mobile-first responsive design using Tailwind's responsive utilities.

### Rationale
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with mobile, add features for larger screens
- **Performance**: Mobile constraints force performance optimization
- **User Base**: Increasing mobile usage for enterprise applications
- **Tailwind Support**: Excellent responsive utilities built-in

### Breakpoints
```
sm: 640px   - Small tablets
md: 768px   - Tablets
lg: 1024px  - Laptops
xl: 1280px  - Desktops
2xl: 1536px - Large screens
```

### Implementation Pattern
```tsx
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-4">
  {/* Responsive grid */}
</div>
```

### Consequences
**Positive**:
- Better mobile experience
- Forced simplification of complex UIs
- Better performance on mobile devices

**Negative**:
- More complex responsive logic
- Need to test on multiple devices
- Some desktop features may need mobile alternatives

## ADR-008: Component Testing Strategy

### Context
Need to ensure components work correctly and prevent regressions.

### Decision
Use React Testing Library for component testing with Jest as test runner.

### Rationale
- **User-Centric**: Tests how users interact with components
- **Best Practices**: Encourages accessible component design
- **Maintainable**: Tests are less likely to break with refactoring
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as usage examples
- **Integration**: Works well with Jest and Create React App

### Testing Approach
1. **Unit Tests**: Individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Component interactions
3. **Snapshot Tests**: Prevent unintended UI changes
4. **Accessibility Tests**: Ensure WCAG compliance

### Example
```typescript
describe('MetricCard', () => {
  it('displays correct value and change', () => {
    render(<MetricCard value={1000} change={5} />);
    
    expect(screen.getByText('1,000')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByText(/5%/)).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

### Consequences
**Positive**:
- Confidence in refactoring
- Catch bugs early
- Better component design
- Living documentation

**Negative**:
- Time investment for writing tests
- Test maintenance overhead
- Learning curve for team

### Decision
Use Lucide React icon library for all icons.

### Rationale
- **React-First**: React components, not SVG files
- **Tree-Shakeable**: Only import icons you use
- **Consistent Design**: Unified icon style
- **Customizable**: Easy to adjust size and color
- **TypeScript**: Full type definitions
- **Small Bundle**: ~1KB per icon

### Usage
```tsx
import { TrendingUp, Calendar, Search } from 'lucide-react';

<TrendingUp className="w-5 h-5 text-green-500" />
```

### Consequences
**Positive**:
- Professional, consistent look
- Easy to use and customize
- Small performance impact
- Accessible by default

**Negative**:
- Limited to available icons
- Another dependency
- May need custom icons for brand-specific needs

### Alternatives Considered
- Font Awesome
- Material Icons
- Heroicons
- Custom SVG icons
